# Quarter Moon Color Scheme (Syntax) for Atom
Based on New Moon: https://taniarascia.github.io/new-moon/

The New Moon theme is great but the contrast is just a bit too low. This is a simple fork with a darker background and a couple of other small color tweaks.

Like the original, this is optimized for front end web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
